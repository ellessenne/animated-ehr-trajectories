# Animated Longitudinal Trajectories

A quick example on how to create animated plots representing longitudinal trajectories that develop over time using R, {ggplot2}, and the `animate` package in LaTeX.

See the [`example.Rmd`](https://github.com/ellessenne/animated-ehr-trajectories/blob/main/example.Rmd) file for all the details; if you clone this repository, it *should* just work (assuming all packages are available).
Please [file an issue](https://github.com/ellessenne/animated-ehr-trajectories/issues) if it doesn't.
